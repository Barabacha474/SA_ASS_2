# INSTALLING AND USAGE

Download project (python3 and some libraries necessary)



Open project with IDE (PyCharm preferably)

Go to the testing folder

Run compound setup

OR

Run Server.py

Run up to 100 Client.py

Remember about -ipp (--ip_port) and -ipps(--ip_port_server) attributes necessary for Server.py and Client.py. They should be equal for client to be able to connect to the server.

Send "GET number of messages" message as a client to get number of all messages in current session

# Testing

Run AutomatePerfomanceTest.py. It will show time of server rising, client connection, message sending and how much codes differ from previous tested version.
